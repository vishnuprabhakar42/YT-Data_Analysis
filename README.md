.# YT-Data_Analysis

-> This project involves creating a Python program to gather information from YouTube using the YouTube Data API. The collected data is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and simple visualizations are created using Seaborn library.

->This project begins by obtaining an API key for YouTube, which serves as authorization to access the platform's data. The process for creating an API key will be explained in detail. After the key is obtained, we will explore the YouTube API documentation to learn how to retrieve various types of data. The documentation will guide us on how to utilize different resources and methods through sample Python code to gather the necessary information for the project.

->To conclude the project, we will write the necessary Python code to complete it. The code will be written in Jupyter Notebook. To keep the project separate from others, a new virtual environment will be created using Anaconda. Once the virtual environment is established, the necessary packages will be installed, such as "google-api-python-client" for accessing YouTube API data, as well as Pandas and Seaborn. The steps for creating a virtual environment and installing packages will be thoroughly demonstrated.

->Once the environment and necessary packages are set up, we will begin writing the code in Jupyter Notebook. The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will extract information about YouTube channels, such as channel name, number of subscribers, total views, and number of videos. We will collect this information for several channels related to data analysis and data science, and then compare the data between them. We will look at which channel has the most subscribers, the most views, and the number of videos posted. This data will be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and basic visualizations will be created to easily compare the channels.

->In the second portion of the project, we will develop a method to extract information about videos from a specific channel. This includes details such as the video title, number of views, likes, dislikes, and comments for all videos posted by the channel. The data will then be analyzed by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame, and simple visualizations will be created using the Seaborn library.
